In case you want to change the colorscheme of the bar, you can go in the $HOME/.config/bspwm/rices/poly/schemes/ folder.

There you can change the name of the color you would like to use to colors.ini
and then rename the current one with anything but with the .ini extension in the end (in case you change your mind and want to go back you can just rename it again to colors.ini)
