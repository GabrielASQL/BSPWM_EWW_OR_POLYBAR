# BSPWM EWW OR POLYBAR
Some rices I made, a polybar one with my colorscheme, and two Eww bars (light and dark themes).

# If you want you can just copy everything as listed bellow, but you can choose some optional asciiarts.
directories to copy to: 
home = $HOME/
dot_config = $HOME/.config/
local = $HOME/.local/

# This is the optional asciiarts, in case you want then to spawn with zsh simply put then in:
optional_ascii = $HOME/.local/share/asciiart/


# Dependencies
I don't know if everything works on your system, because I mostly used the AUR (archlinux), In case you want to try compiling manually and go hunting for some fonts, maybe some things will break:

1 - picom (in almost all repositories, apt, pacman, etc);
2 - zsh (same thing as the first);
3 - polybar (same thing as the first);
4 - eww-bar (Its in the AUR, in case you're not in Arch, you have to compile it. Only necessary if you want to use the other two themes I made, the sidebar ones, in case you just want the top one, polybar is enough);

5 - Fonts:
    - Material Design Icons Desktop;
    - JetBrainsMono Nerd Font;
    - Comic Mono;
    - Fira Code;
    - Terminess Nerd Font.
